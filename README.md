# Quora_Question_Pairs

Quora Question Pairs is an NLP project that aims to identify duplicate questions on the Quora platform. The project involves the following steps:

Data collection: Gathering a large dataset of question pairs from Quora.

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters, and converting the text to lowercase.

Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as the word overlap between the questions, the length of the questions, and the similarity of the questions.

Model training: Building a machine learning model that uses the extracted features to predict whether a pair of questions is duplicate or not.

Model evaluation: Testing the accuracy and performance of the model on a separate dataset.

Deployment: Deploying the model in a production environment, such as a web application or API, to provide real-time predictions.

The Quora Question Pairs project is valuable because it helps to improve the quality of questions on the Quora platform by identifying duplicate questions and reducing redundancy. It also helps to improve the user experience by providing more relevant and diverse content.
